<body>
<h1>I love cake. I'm not afraid to shout it to the mountain top</h1>
<p class="cake-text">That's right. I love 
    all kinds of cake. Chocolate, vanilla, cherry and fruit based. 
If there is extra frosting or marzipan, all the better. I would happily
run a 5k if there was cake at the finish line</p>
